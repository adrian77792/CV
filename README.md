To deploy your site, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare your repository**: Make sure your project contains the main files like `index.html`, `style.css`, etc. If you haven‚Äôt created a GitHub repository yet, you can initialize one and push your code using the following commands:

   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Enable GitHub Pages**:  
   - Go to your repository on GitHub.  
   - Click on **Settings**.  
   - From the left-hand menu, select **Pages**.  
   - Under **Source**, choose the `main` branch and the `/ (root)` folder.  
   - Click **Save**.

3. **Access your live website**:  
   After a few seconds, GitHub will generate a public URL for your website. It typically looks like:  
   ```
   https://your-username.github.io/your-repository/
   ```
   Example:  
   ```
   https://adrian77792.github.io/CV/
   ```

```bash
